# Obstruction Adaptive Elevation Mask API
![](images/oaemapi.jpg)
This API computes an Obstruction Adaptive Elevation Mask (OAEM) for a given position using CityGML models. An OAEM describes the obstruction of the sky view, e.g. due to buildings, using azimuth and elevation pairs. The term Obstruction Adaptive Elevation Mask was first used by [Zimmermann 2019](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329833465_GPS-Multipath_Analysis_using_Fresnel-Zones). The CityGML models can either be retrieved from [local file storage](https://www.opengeodata.nrw.de/produkte/geobasis/3dg/lod2_gml/lod2_gml/) or from the [Web-Feature-Service (WFS) of Geobasis North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW)](https://www.wfs.nrw.de/geobasis/wfs_nw_3d-gebaeudemodell_lod1).

Geoid information are provived by:

The code is designed for LOD1 or LOD2 building models from Geobasis NRW, Germany. In its current state, it is therefore only applicable within North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

An OAEM can be useful in various scenarios including GNSS Signal filtering:
